My life aim is to work on open-source projects and collaborate with other developers. I use GitHub for small projects and GitLab for larger ones, so my activity may not be fully reflected on GitHub.</p>

## Open-Source Projects

My life aim is to work on projects developer-to-developer, and I'm always looking for open-source collaborations. Check out my big projects on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/LorenzoRottigni) and my smaller projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/LorenzoRottigni). Keep in mind that I use GitHub for small projects, so my activities aren't completely tracked there.
